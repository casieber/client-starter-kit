# client-starter-kit
My own personal, opinionated boilerplate for client web app code

## Getting Started

To get everything up and running you can simply follow these commands:

```sh
# clone repo
git clone https://github.com/casieber/client-starter-kit.git

# change directory
cd client-starter-kit

# run init script
node init.js

# start kit in dev mode
npm start
```

This will retrieve the starter kit sources, install all dependencies, replace old git link with a fresh git initialization, delete the init script, and start the project in dev mode at http://localhost:3000.
